# Vehicles & Trailers Module

**Status:** üî¥ Not Started (Next after Drivers)
**Types:** LKV (Heavy Trucks) + PKV (Light Vehicles) + Trailers

## Business Logic

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå No centralized vehicle database
‚ùå Service schedules tracked in Excel
‚ùå Fines arrive months late (lost paperwork)
‚ùå Cannot see which vehicles are available
‚ùå Accident costs not tracked per vehicle
```

**Solution:**
```
‚úÖ Digital vehicle profiles (technical specs + documents)
‚úÖ Service request system (internal + external)
‚úÖ Fine/accident tracking
‚úÖ Availability dashboard
‚úÖ Cost per vehicle analytics
```

## Transport Unit Concept

**Definition:** Transport Unit = Driver + Vehicle + Trailer

**Ready State:**
```typescript
interface TransportUnit {
    driver: {
        id: string;
        status: 'active';
        all_documents_valid: true;  // All üü¢ or üü°
    };
    vehicle: {
        id: string;
        type: 'lkv';
        all_documents_valid: true;
        not_in_service: true;
    };
    trailer: {
        id: string;
        type: 'standard' | 'mega' | 'frigo';
        all_documents_valid: true;
        not_in_service: true;
    };
    ready_for_order: true;
}
```

**Order Assignment:**
```
When Dispatcher creates Order:
1. Select Transport Unit from "Ready" list
2. Order.transport_unit_id = [unit_id]
3. System tracks:
   - Which driver drove
   - Which vehicle was used
   - Which trailer was attached
4. If accident/fine ‚Üí linked to correct driver + vehicle
```

## Service Management

**Scenario 1: Planned Service (Internal)**

```
1. Vehicle VEH-0045 has 95,000 km
2. System alert: "Service due at 100,000 km"
3. HR/Admin creates Service Request:
   - Type: Scheduled Maintenance
   - Service Provider: Internal Workshop
   - Scheduled Date: 2025-11-05
4. Mechanic performs service:
   - Oil change
   - Brake inspection
   - Filter replacement
5. Cost: 3,500 CZK (internal labor + parts)
6. Vehicle status: Back to Active
```

**Scenario 2: Emergency Repair (External)**

```
1. Driver reports: "Strange engine noise"
2. Dispatcher creates Service Request:
   - Priority: üî¥ High
   - Location: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland
   - Issue: Engine noise

   - Auto Service PL (5 km) ‚≠ê 4.5/5
   - MAN Service Center (12 km) ‚≠ê 4.8/5
4. Dispatcher selects: Auto Service PL
5. Service completed:
