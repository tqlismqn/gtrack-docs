# Design System Overview

## Introduction
G-Track Design System is a comprehensive collection of design standards, components, and patterns used throughout the G-Track TMS platform.

## Purpose
This design system ensures:
- **Consistency** across all modules and features
- **Efficiency** in development by providing reusable components
- **Quality** through adherence to modern UX best practices
- **Accessibility** for all users

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity
Every interface element should be clear and understandable. Users should immediately know what actions they can take and what information they're viewing.

### 2. Efficiency
Minimize the steps needed to complete tasks. Provide shortcuts and smart defaults wherever possible.

### 3. Consistency
Use the same patterns, components, and terminology throughout the application. This reduces cognitive load and learning time.

### 4. Professional Appearance
G-Track is a business application. The design should be clean, professional, and inspire confidence.

### 5. Responsive
All interfaces must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
