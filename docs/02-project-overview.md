# Project Overview

## What is G-Track?

G-Track transforms chaotic Excel-based transport management into a streamlined digital platform. The system eliminates manual document tracking, prevents expired licenses from causing fines, optimizes order assignment, and provides real-time financial insights.

## Client Pain Points

### Problem 1: Document Chaos (Drivers)

```
Client has 150-170 drivers in Excel spreadsheet
❌ No visibility on document expiration dates
❌ Manual checking every week (5+ hours)
❌ Missed expirations → fines, insurance issues
❌ Cannot quickly answer "Who is ready for delivery?"
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Automated expiration tracking (14 document types)
✅ Visual status indicators (🟢🟡🔴)
✅ Email/SMS alerts 30/15/7 days before expiry
✅ "Readiness Dashboard" - see who can work TODAY
✅ Mobile upload via Telegram Bot
```

### Problem 2: Order Assignment Inefficiency

```
Dispatcher spends 30-45 minutes per order:
❌ Check driver availability (documents OK?)
❌ Check vehicle status (service due?)
❌ Check trailer availability
❌ Manual Excel updates
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Transport Unit = Driver + Vehicle + Trailer (pre-validated)
✅ One-click order assignment
✅ Automatic status transitions
✅ Real-time availability view
```

### Problem 3: Financial Opacity

```
❌ Unknown profitability per order/driver
❌ Hidden costs (fines, damages, repairs)
❌ Manual calculations in Excel
❌ No visibility on VAT handling
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Real-time profitability tracking
✅ Automatic cost allocation (fines → driver → order)
✅ EU VAT compliance (Reverse Charge automation)
✅ Financial dashboards by driver/vehicle/customer
```
