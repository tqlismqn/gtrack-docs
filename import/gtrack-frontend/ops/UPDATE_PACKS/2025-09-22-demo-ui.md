# 2025-09-22 â€” Drivers demo UI drop

## Summary
- Replace scaffold placeholder with production-ready static assets for `/demo/drivers/`.
- Ship standalone HTML/CSS/JS bundle to serve via demo.g-track.eu host rewrite.
- Persist demo interactions entirely in browser storage to avoid backend dependencies.

## Roll-out Notes
- Assets deploy with the standard Next.js static export pipeline. No feature flag needed.
- Validate post-deploy by loading `/demo/drivers/` on preview and the `demo.g-track.eu` vanity domain once DNS is active.
- If localStorage carries legacy scaffold data, instruct QA to clear storage via DevTools before validating the new UI.

## Checklist
- [x] Search field filters table and badge grid.
- [x] Status and document filters reflect correct badge colours.
- [x] Drawer opens from table row or quick badge.
- [x] Add/remove driver actions persist across reloads.
- [x] Document indicator colours match ok/warn/bad thresholds.
