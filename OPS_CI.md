# Docs CI (slim mode)
- Auto: Docs â€“ Deploy on push to main (online install fallback; offline wheelhouse used if present).
- Manual only: Verify Offline, Refresh Wheels, Repo Discovery, Healthcheck, check-docs.
- Rationale: stabilize docs CI while iterating; strict/offline guards can be re-enabled later.
